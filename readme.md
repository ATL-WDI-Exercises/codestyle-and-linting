# Code Style Lab

Your mission is to clean up ugly JavaScript code. First use `node` to run `friends.js` and see that it runs correctly, but it's ***ugly***. Then edit the file `friends.js` and test it using `eslint`:

```bash
npm install
node friends.js
./node_modules/.bin/eslint friends.js
subl friends.js
```

Keep improving the code until you get no more errors from `eslint`. Then run it again to ensure that it still runs correctly:

```bash
node friends.js
```
